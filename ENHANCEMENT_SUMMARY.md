- **Evidence-based feedback** - Concrete data to support review comments
- **Actionable insights** - Specific steps for improvement rather than generic advice

### Usage Workflow Enhancement

#### Before Enhancement (Basic Workflow)
1. `get_review_prompts()` - Get guidelines
2. `get_pr_details()` - Basic PR info
3. `get_pr_files()` - File changes
4. Manual analysis by LLM
5. `post_pr_review()` - Submit review

#### After Enhancement (Comprehensive Workflow)
1. `get_review_prompts()` - Get guidelines ‚≠ê
2. `get_pr_details()` + `get_repo_info()` - Context gathering
3. `get_pr_files()` - File changes
4. **Enhanced Analysis Phase**:
   - `analyze_code_quality()` - Quality metrics
   - `detect_security_issues()` - Security scan
   - `analyze_diff_impact()` - Risk assessment
   - `detect_code_patterns()` - Pattern analysis
   - `analyze_dependencies()` - Dependency check
   - `analyze_test_coverage()` - Testing analysis
   - `generate_suggestions()` - Specific improvements
5. `post_pr_review()` - Submit comprehensive review with quantified data
